# Financial Transaction Analytics Dashboard
The dashboard empowers financial analysts and management teams to monitor cash flow dynamics, assess operational performance across branches and banks, understand customer transaction behavior, and strengthen fraud detection measures.

## Dataset Used
<a href = "https://github.com/Bajpai777/Tableau-Financial-Transaction-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/Cleaned_debit%20and%20credit%20data.xlsx">Sample Dataset</a> | <a href= "https://github.com/Bajpai777/Tableau-Financial-Transaction-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/Finance%20Analysis%20Dashboard.twbx">Financial Transaction Analytics Dataset</a>

## Sample Reports:
1. Portfolio Overview.
2. Risk & Repayment Analysis.

## Process
- Requirement Gathering & Dataset Preparation.
- Use the Sample Finance Analysis dataset.
- Data Preparation-Connect to Finance Analysis dataset in Tableau, And Create calculated fields.
- Create KPI cards: Total Credit Amount, Total Debit Amount, Credit to Debit Ratio, and Net Transaction Amount And Account Activity Ratio.
- Created Visuals- Transactions per Day/Week/Month, Total Transaction Amount by Branch, Transaction Volume by Bank, Transaction Method Distribution, Branch Transaction Growth.
- Created Next Visuals For- High-Risk Transaction Flag and  Suspicious Transaction Frequency.
- Adding Filters and Interactivity-Create filters for Branch Wise and Bank Wise.
- Dashboard Design & Layout.
- Formatting & User Experience-Titles & tooltips must dynamically update using Metric Parameter.
- Testing & Validation-Test all requirements.
- Publish dashboard to Tableau Public and Verify interactive features online (links, filters, parameter actions).

## Project Insight
- Total Credit Amount – Displays the total deposits or credits made, highlighting the inflow of funds and allowing comparison with withdrawals.
- Total Debit Amount – Shows the total withdrawals or debits, reflecting the outflow of funds.
- Credit to Debit Ratio – Compares total credits to total debits to assess whether inflows exceed outflows.
- Net Transaction Amount – Represents net cash flow (credits minus debits) to evaluate the overall financial movement.
- Account Activity Ratio – Indicates how frequently transactions occur relative to account balances, identifying active versus dormant accounts.
- Transactions per Day/Week/Month – Tracks transaction trends over time to uncover activity patterns and seasonal variations.
- Total Transaction Amount by Branch – Compares total transaction volumes across branches to evaluate branch-level performance.
- Transaction Volume by Bank – Summarizes and compares transaction activity across different banks.
- Transaction Method Distribution – Analyzes the usage of different transaction channels (e.g., Bank Transfer, Debit Card, Credit Card) to understand customer preferences.
- Branch Transaction Growth – Measures growth or decline in branch transaction volumes over defined periods to track performance trends.
- High-Risk Transaction Flag – Identifies transactions that exceed predefined thresholds or exhibit unusual activity for risk monitoring.
- Suspicious Transaction Frequency – Tracks how often high-risk or flagged transactions occur to assess the level of potential fraud exposure.
